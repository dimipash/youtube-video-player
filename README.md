# YouTube Video Player with Analytics

This project is a work-in-progress application that provides a YouTube video player with integrated analytics tracking capabilities.

The project is split into two main parts:

1.  **Backend**: Developed using FastAPI, located in the `fastapi/video-analytics-api` directory. This handles the API endpoints for analytics data.
2.  **Frontend**: Developed using Next.js, located in the `nextjs/video-player` directory. This provides the user interface for playing videos and potentially viewing analytics.

## Project Status

This project is currently under active development.

## Setup and Running

Please refer to the individual README files within the `fastapi/video-analytics-api` and `nextjs/video-player` directories for specific setup and running instructions for each part of the application.
